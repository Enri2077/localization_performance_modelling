## global planner configuration
# http://wiki.ros.org/global_planner#Parameters
GlobalPlanner:
  allow_unknown: true  # default: true  # Specifies whether or not to allow the planner to create plans that traverse unknown space. NOTE: if you are using a layered costmap_2d costmap with a voxel or obstacle layer, you must also set the track_unknown_space param for that layer to be true, or it will convert all your unknown space to free space (which planner will then happily go right through).
  default_tolerance: 0.0  # default: 0.0  # A tolerance on the goal point for the planner. The planner will attempt to create a plan that is as close to the specified goal as possible but no further than default_tolerance away.
  use_dijkstra: true   # default: true  # If true, use dijkstra's algorithm. Otherwise, A*.
  use_quadratic: true  # default: true  # If true, use the quadratic approximation of the potential. Otherwise, use a simpler calculation.
  use_grid_path: true  # default: false  # If true, create a path that follows the grid boundaries. Otherwise, use a gradient descent method.
  old_navfn_behavior: true  # default: false  # If for some reason, you want global_planner to exactly mirror the behavior of navfn, set this to true (and use the defaults for the other boolean parameters)
  lethal_cost: 253  # default: 253  # Lethal Cost (dynamic reconfigure)
  neutral_cost: 50  # default: 50  # Neutral Cost (dynamic reconfigure)
